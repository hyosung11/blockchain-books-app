# Blockchain Book Search

## 1. Description
  This app takes information from the google books API and finds search results related to blockchain technology in the categories of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts.

## 2. Technologies Used
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.

## 3. Approach Taken
As my first project, I wanted to manifest a minimum viable product that aligns with the KISS design principle. In addition, if I could create something with a modicum of visual appeal and a smidgen of new information for the user, then I would have considered it a success because it traversed the low bar I set for myself.
