# Blockchain Book Search

## 1. Description
  This app takes information from the google books API and finds search results related to blockchain technology in the categories of blockchain, cryptocurrency, and smart contracts.

## 2. Technologies Used
This project uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX.

## 3. Approach Taken
As my first project, I wanted to manifest a minimum viable product that aligns with the KISS design principle. In addition, if I could create something with a modicum of visual appeal and a smidgen of new information for the user, then I would have considered it a success because it traversed the low bar I set for myself.

## 5. Unsolved Problems
I like to think of the following list as unsolved but not unsolveable problems:
  1. Render the pictures from the API in a higher quality when they're expanded in the search results.
  2. Find a stock image for books that don't have a cover image.
  3. For books without certain content included in the API here are a few thoughts: 1) hard code content, 2) find other info links, or 3) include dummy text.
  4. Figure out how to concatenate words and symbols into the API data, so that for example, the author's name has "by" before their name.
  5. Unable to scroll the modal text to reach the close button at the bottom in mobile devices.
  6. Make money by creating affiliate links for the books to Amazon, Barnes & Noble, etc.

## 6. Thoughts About Process
As I delved into my first project I kept the following things in mind:
  1. You are an engineer.
  2. Slow preparation ... fast execution.
  3. Only a part, not the whole.
  4. Not building a wall, but making a brick.

Finally, I don't know what I don't know, but I know that I know very little about software engineering at this point; however, it's a hell of a lot more than I knew a month ago.
